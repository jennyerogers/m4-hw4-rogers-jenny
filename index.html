            <h2 id="About"> About</h2>
            <p>Frank Ocean is an American singer and songwriter from New Orleans, Louisiana. Winner of two Grammy awards, Ocean has left his mark on the music industry. </p>
            <p> I first discovered Frank Ocean in middle school. The first song I ever listened to was "Thinkin Bout You." I loved the rawness of his lyrics paired with his distinct, smooth voice. Ever since, I've been a huge fan! </p>
            <p>My favorite song by Frank Ocean is called "Self Control," off his "Blonde" album.</p>
            <p>Though he is well-loved, Ocean is notorious for hardly showing face in public or giving performances. He has not released a studio album since his 2016 album titled "Blonde." </p>
            <p>Fans have been awaiting another release of a studio album for years, but Ocean has made no comment on when the next release will be. Fans are hopeful that Ocean will drop new music before his 2023 Coachella performance. </p>
